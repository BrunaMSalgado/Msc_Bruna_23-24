# Lambda-calculus with conditionals

## Syntax
1. Prove that all judgements have a unique derivation (Theorem 2.3, MFPS
   paper)
2. Prove exchange and substitution (Lemma 2.4, MFPS paper)
3. Present the corresponding equational system (LMCS paper) 
4. Show examples of programs written in lambda-calculus, with particular focus
   on quantum but *not* necessarily just quantum

## Semantics
1. Present the interpretation of lambda-calculus with conditionals via monoidal
   closed categories with coproducts
2. Prove "semantic" exchange and substitution (Lemma 4, MFPS paper)
3. Prove soundness (Theorem 5, MFPS paper)
4. Give examples of monoidal (not necessarily closed) categories with
   coproducts. Some examples may include:
    a. the category of reals, 
    b. the category of metric spaces, 
    c. the category whose objects are sets and morphisms are relations,
    d. the category CPTP with coproducts (!!)
    ...
 
# Metric equations

## Syntax
1. Present the metric equational system with conditionals

## Semantics
1. Present the interpretation of the equational system via monoidal closed
   categories with coproducts and enriched over metric spaces
2. Prove soundness (and completeness?) (Theorem 3.13, MFPS paper)
