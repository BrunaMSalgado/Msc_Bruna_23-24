\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Renato Neves, for his invaluable guidance, unwavering patience, and for guiding me into this journey into the fascinating world of formal methods. This journey would not have been possible without his expertise and encouragement.

I am also deeply grateful to my parents, who have always supported and encouraged me to give my best, providing everything I needed along the way, and to my brother, who cheers me on just as much as he annoys me with his antics.

My heartfelt thanks also go to my dear friends Vitória, Margarida, Gabriela, Gonçalo, Rui, Fábio, and Miguel—especially for the cheerful lunches that left me smiling like a madwoman in the afternoons, never failing to lift my spirits during moments of endless frustration.

Juliana, Nico, and Vitor will always have my sincere gratitude for helping me whenever they could (or at least trying to), and for the occasional much-needed laugh. This gratitude also extends to another (semi-)frequent lab visitor, Alexandra.

Finally, I would like to thank INESC TEC and FCT for the research  grant attributed for developing this dissertation project, with reference  \texttt{PTDC/CCI-COM/4280/2021}.
