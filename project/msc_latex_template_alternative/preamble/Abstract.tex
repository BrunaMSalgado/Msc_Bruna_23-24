\chapter*{Abstract}

Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)  computers are expected to operate with severely limited hardware resources. Precisely controlling qubits in these systems comes at a high cost, is susceptible to errors, and faces scarcity challenges. Therefore, error analysis is indispensable for the design, optimization, and assessment of NISQ computing. Nevertheless, the analysis of errors in quantum programs poses a significant challenge. The overarching goal of the M.Sc. project is to provide a fully-fledged
quantum programming language on which to study metric program equivalence
in various scenarios, such as in quantum algorithmics and quantum information theory.


\paragraph{Keywords} approximate equivalence, $\lambda$-calculus, metric equations
